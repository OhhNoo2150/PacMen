# PacMen Factory Project



give it a go here https://OhhNoo2150.github.io/PacMen

## Description

In this project we were tasked with creating a simple game where you click a button (as many times as you'd like) to create multiple PacMen on the screen, you then click 'start game' to get the pacmen to start bouncing off the walls like a rockstar on a cocaine bender. you can add as many pacmen as you want, and to get them moving quicker you click start game multiple times and they pick up speed. 
## Getting Started
We were provided some start files to begin the work, I'm not sure where you would get the starter files from or you could just copy and paste the code that I have in my repository to get started
### Dependencies 
it depends
### Installing 
you have a couple ways to get this up and running
1. You can copy my code, create individual repositories like I did and set up github pages to access them (make sure that you use the naming convention of index.html or it won't load on the screen.)
2. You can sign up for this bootcamp and they'll show you how to do it
3. you're a programming wizard and can do this on your own cause you don't need a bootcamp you're that great.
### Executing program 
If you don't already have a github profile, you'll want to create one (i'm not sure where you're accessing this from if you don't already have one)
create a repository 
add the files
index.html
styles.css
script.js 
copy the files from my files into those files, add them to your repo, set up github pages and it will run it for you.
